2. Data Description
Describe your dataset: source, variables, number of samples, etc.

Include data types and basic statistics.

3. Data Exploration and Visualization
Univariate Visualization: Plot and interpret single variables (e.g., histograms, boxplots).

Multivariate Visualization: Examine relationships between variables (e.g., scatter plots, heatmaps).

4. Machine Learning
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and encode categorical variables.

Modelling and Evaluation: Use at least one classical ML model (e.g., Linear Regression) and one neural network (e.g., ANN). Evaluate performance using appropriate metrics.
